## Introduction
This project is a web-based user interface for [Reading for Gender Bias](https://github.com/glam-lab/gender-bias). 
This project is currently under active development by members of [GLAM Lab at Whitman College](https://github.com/orgs/glam-lab/) to create an accessible tool. 

## Technologies
* [Vue Framework](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/#:~:text=Vue%20(pronounced%20%2Fvju%CB%90%2F%2C,up%20to%20be%20incrementally%20adoptable))
* [Puppeteer, mocha, chai](https://medium.com/@ankit_m/ui-testing-with-puppeteer-and-mocha-part-1-getting-started-b141b2f9e21) for testing. 
* Either [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/) or [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/) for package management.

## Installation and Usage
### Backend installation process 
```
git clone https://github.com/gender-bias/gender-bias
cd gender-bias
pip3 install -e .
```
NOTE: The last line in the above snippet installs this library in "editable" mode, which is probably fine while the library is in a state of flux.

### Package Managers to run the project 
To set up the project, install a package manager such as yarn or npm. Then run either
```
yarn install
```
or 
```
npm install
``` 
### Running the front-end 
Once installed, use yarn or npm to open the server locally:
```
yarn serve
```
or 
```
npm run server
``` 

To lint and fix files:
```
yarn lint
```
