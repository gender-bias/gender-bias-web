                        Implicit gender bias in evaluations negatively impacts
                        women at every stage of her career.
                    </b>
                    The goal of this project is to create a web-based text
                    analysis tool that scans and reveals language bias
                    associated with evaluations and letters of recommendation
                    written for trainees and applicants. The tool will provide a
                    summary of potential changes to the writer to help them
                    remove bias. The hope is that by bringing awareness to the
                    existence of implicit bias, we can change how evaluations
                    for women are drafted and judged, thereby providing a
                    concrete way to tackle gender disparities.
